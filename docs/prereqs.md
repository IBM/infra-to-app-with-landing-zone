Make sure that you meet the following prerequisites before you begin the lab.

## IBM Cloud

1.  An IBM Cloud Pay-Go or Subscription account (trial accounts are not sufficient)

2. A personal API Key associated with a user with the following permissions.

    :information_source: **Note**:  The user account provided in the TechXchange lab already has got the necessary permissions. Participants in the TechXchange lab only need to create an API Key as described below.

To create an API Key: \
    1. In the IBM Cloud console, in the navigation bar at the top of your screen, go to **Manage > Access (IAM) > API keys.** \
    2. Click **Create +**. \
    3. Enter a name, for example `<yourinitials> lab` and optionally a description for your API key. \
    4. Click **Create** \
    5. Then, click **Show** (the eye icon) to display the API key.
