# IBM Cloud for Financial Cloud Services Framework

IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services provides comprehensive and detailed guidance around regulatory compliance, security, and resiliency to help address the needs of enterprises both during initial deployment and with ongoing operations. For more information, see [Getting started with IBM Cloud for Financial Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about).

The framework was initially based on the needs of financial institutions, as its name indicates. However, it can be used as a compliance and security starting point and baseline for most industries.

The framework provides secure [VPC reference architectures](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about) that meet a number of regulatory controls.
