# Deploying Landing Zone VSI pattern through IBM Cloud Project

1. On your machine, create an SSH key pair via the command:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N '' -f ./lab-key
   ```
   This command generates two files in the current directory: `lab-key` (the private key) and `lab-key.pub` (the public key).
   Verify that the keys have been created in the current directory.
   ```
   ls lab-key*
   ```
   This should return:
   ```
   lab-key  lab-key.pub
   ```
2. Access the [VSI on VPC landing zone Deployable Architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/architecture/deploy-arch-ibm-slz-vsi-ef663980-4c71-4fac-af4f-4a510a9bcf68-global?catalog_query=aHR0cHM6Ly9jbG91ZC5pYm0uY29tL2NhdGFsb2cjcmVmZXJlbmNlX2FyY2hpdGVjdHVyZQ%3D%3D)
