# Lab 2: Automating deployment, and sharing through a private IBM Cloud Catalog

Lab 1 shows how you can leverage existing landing-zone automation to deploy most of the topology, and then customize and deploy on top of that infrastructure.

The purpose of lab 2 is to show of the manual steps in lab 1 can be fully automated. Lab 2 will also show how the fully automated custom solution can be shared with other users in your enterprise through the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog).

Lab 2 assumes a basic knowledge of [Terraform](https://www.ibm.com/topics/terraform).
