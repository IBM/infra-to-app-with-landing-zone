# Lab 2: Automating deployment and sharing through a private catalog

In lab 1, you deployed most of the landing zone topology, and then customized the infrastructure.

Now in lab 2, you use automation to accomplish what you did manually in lab 1. Lab 2 also demonstrates how you can share the fully automated custom solution with other users in your enterprise through the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog).

Lab 2 assumes a basic knowledge of [Terraform](https://www.ibm.com/topics/terraform).
