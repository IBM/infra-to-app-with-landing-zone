# Seamless Deployment: From Provisioning to Runtime with IBM Cloud’s Landing Zone

This deployable architecture automates all of the deployment steps to:
 1. Provision a VPC-based topology aligned with best practices from the [IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about).
 2. Deploy an Apache web server on top of this secure topology

This deployable architecture is built in the context of the lab *Seamless Deployment: From Provisioning to Runtime with IBM Cloud’s Landing Zone*. Instructions for the lab can be found at: https://ibm.github.io/infra-to-app-with-landing-zone/
